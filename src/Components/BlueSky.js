The creator came in with a new intent, to create a user-focused platform to connect with similar-minded platforms. The goal of this was to be able to interface with those other platforms, such as Mastadon, and rather than create an exclusive app, like Twitter and Facebook and etc, create an inclusive application in which people from across multiple mediums could communicate. This outlook of inclusivity and connected-ness speaks to me and is genuinely wonderfull to see nowadays. BlueSky development is fully remote meaning I could move to wherever I wanted to, which is nice. I cant find information on the pay scale and benefits package but if the cause is right that can be managed.

                    Just as with the others, I will need to learn a few new skills as well as polish my current skills in order to be able to perform at this positions properly. The new skills include Postgres, and Cassandra.

                    As my own interests align with the company goal I think my accomplishments there would be to further that goal with them, rather than anything specific.
