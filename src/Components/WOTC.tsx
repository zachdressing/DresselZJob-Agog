If you do not know, they produce Magic the Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons, a card game that I play as often as I can and the tabletop game that brought me and my friends together since elementary school. Coincidentally, WOTC is located in Renton, WA located only around 30 minutes away from Valves headquarters in Bellevue, meaning the location is already somewhere I want to be. While they don't pay great, the benefits aren't perfect, and the atmosphere seems to be on a bad slope at the moment, it would be a dream come true to work at the place that produces some of my favorite things of all time.

                    If I wanted to be able to secure a position at WOTC, specifically for software engineering I would need to learn new tools, such as Angular and Agile, as well as, similar to the previous pages, work on my current skills in JS and React and etc.

                    Working at WOTC I would want to accomplish the same things that I try to accomplish by playing the games themselves, to foster a good community around the game and to make sure that everyone can be included regardless of anything. I would only be able to do that by working much harder at where Im lacking, with UI work and similar.</p>
