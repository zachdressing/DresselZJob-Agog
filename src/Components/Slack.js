                        Everything lines up similar to Discord and its requirements, and similarly the goal of Slack lines up with my own, to connect people. Slack, of course, in a more professional setting. From what Ive gathered from Glassdoor, it seems that it is still a good place to work with good reviews of the internal culture and an engineers salary averages at ~$200k, which leads me to believe the pay scale has a high ceiling for senior positions. All of the benefits listed on Glassdoor are also rated very highly, and the company has a large amount of posted reviews, so Im lead to believe those are accurate. The only issue is that recently, the company was purchased by Salesforce, and the management change is causing division within the employees. I have personally worked for Salesforce before, and so understand the issues that come along with that, and that is not an issue for me if I were to look for a position at Slack. Slack also has many office locations as well as remote work, so finding a location to work from wouldnt be an issue for me.

                        In order to have the skills required for any position at slack I would first need much more understanding of back-end data, as well as how to properly use their systems.
