                    Creating a space where people can connect with each other lines up perfectly with my belief, and so Discord is the first on my list. The jobs are mostly remote with the office being in San Francisco, which isnt far enough to cause any issues if I pursued a career there. The pay scale for employees seems extremely good, and the benefits are excelent. As good as this is, issues arise when looking at reviews of the workplace, via Glassdoor. It seems that the executives are harsh, some even calling them cruel, and dont respect their workforce even when they bring in results. Even so, being able to work at something that would bring me closer to my goal of connecting people something that I would find worth it to deal with that.

                    In order to be able to work at Discord, I would need to get significantly more advanced than my current self. I have the basics down in the areas that they require but need a lot more understanding of the code in order to properly function at the position.

                    <br />
                    The goals that I would want to achieve while working there line up almost exactly with what is listed as the company goal, to connect communities and bring people together with inclusivity at the forefront.
