Also from checking Glassdoor, it seems that the culture is great for some but poor for others because of the increased freedom given to engineers for projects. For Location, the company does a lot of remote work, however the office location being in Bellevue, WA is nice as that is one of the places that I have been looking at to move to.

                     In order to secure a position at steam, I would need to intensely study and train to get better at full-stack engineering as well as maintain that training in order to keep up.

                     If I was to obtain a position at Valve/Steam, I would want to accomplish the goal of increasing user customizability of certain features for steam, like the library. At the moment it works well and has some features that can be customized but, in my opinion, not enough. I would want to add the ability to change the layout of the screen past just the pages.
